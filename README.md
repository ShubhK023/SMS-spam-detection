In this spam detection analysis, we began by reading the dataset and performing data cleaning, including removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and addressing duplicates. We then conducted exploratory data analysis to understand class distributions and text characteristics. Text preprocessing steps involved tokenizing the text, removing stopwords and special characters, and applying stemming. We extracted features using TF-IDF vectorization and trained multiple classifiers, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with Multinomial Naive Bayes emerging as the top performer. The final model was fine-tuned and tested to ensure robustness in detecting spam.
